# OmegaT scripts: Pseudo-translation

This folder contains one Groovy scripts that can be run in OmegaT to accomplish the following tasks:

* Simulate a translation where every letter is translated as x or X (lower and upper case) and numbers are translated as #. Codes such as HTML-like tags and %CODES% are protected.

Future developments:
- Use other alphabets to simulate translation into Chinese, Arabic, etc.
- Add expansion or contraction rates, to test whether the translation will fit when there is space limit.
